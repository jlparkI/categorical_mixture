Installation
================

Requirements are Python3, ``numpy`` and ``pybind11``, which will be
installed automatically.

Starting with version 0.1.0, catmix can be installed from pypi using:::

  pip install categorical_mix

Note that when installing categorical_mix contains C++ code that has to
be compiled from source. ``pip`` will automatically compile the C++
extension for you when you install.

If you encounter any errors, please report at the project github page.
