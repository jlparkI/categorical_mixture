Making and using predictions
=============================

There are several kinds of predictions we can
make using a fitted model.

1) The *overall* probability that a
new datapoint was generated by this model.
2) The probability that a new
datapoint was generated by a *specific cluster*
in this model.
3) The *most probable* cluster in the model.

We can use (3) to assign a new datapoint to a
cluster. Bear in mind however: if the probability
of a new datapoint given the model is very low,
you should not assign it to a cluster, because
it's sufficiently different from the training set
that model predictions for this new datapoint are
likely not useful. We'll see how to determine
when we should not make a cluster assignment shortly.

If you have a fitted model called `my_model`, you can
do the following:
